  The default branch is the "master" brach that is using the newest ccm version and shadow DOM, 
  all JQuery plugins do not work with this branch
  
  The working branch is the "ccm-v6" branch, it uses ccm version 6.6.1 (19.08.2016) and therefore no shadow DOM 
  and all JQuery plugins do  work with this branch
